# sass2css

After having struggled for many years with the Node.js (node_modules) hell, if decided to create this alternative for my frontend theming workflow.

Currently, it includes sass to css compilation (with [SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc)) and browser syncing on file change (replacing [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io)).

Feel free to use it to your liking.
